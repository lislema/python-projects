# fileage-analyser 

a command-line tool that analyzes all the files in a given parent directory and its subdirectories, categorizing the files based on their age (e.g., created less than a week ago, between a week and a month old, or older than a month). It provides a summary report with counts for each category and highlights the oldest and newest files.
